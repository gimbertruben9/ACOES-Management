## Configuring Frontend 

1. npm install @angular/cli
2. ng new frontend
3. cd frontend
4. ng serve (for running frontend in http://localhost:4200/)

For creating a new component go to frontend/src/app and run:
- ng generate component component-name (generates the directory of the new component with 4 files)
